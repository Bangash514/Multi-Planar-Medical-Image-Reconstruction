Multi-planar medical image reconstruction is a complex topic that involves many different algorithms and techniques. While it is possible to create a basic demo in C++, the full implementation of a multi-planar medical image reconstruction system would require significant time and resources.

That being said, here is an example of how to use the ITK library in C++ to perform multi-planar reconstruction:
